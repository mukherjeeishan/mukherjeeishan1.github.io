		<p><h3>Learning agreement</h3>

		I consider my main strength to be my ability to understand others viewpoints and incorporate these ideas into my own work. I often learn best from simply looking at the work of others and taking ideas and
		feedback which are applied into my own projects. My technical understanding is also fairly good e.g. it does not take me long to grasp new technical concepts once I am looking in the right place.
		My limitations are my lack of confidence and my tendency to get distracted from the task at hand. Often I know exactly what to do and how to do it however my lack of confidence and fear of failure prevents
		me from actually making a start and trying something new.
		<br>
		<br>
		In order to manage my workload in this programme I will make good use of the suggested timer (toggl) to track my time. I will also use a calendar to plan when I work throughout the day and have the bulk of my
		study done mid-morning to late afternoon as this is when I am most effective.  I will ensure that when I do this I leave enough time for breaks for me to pursue my other hobbies and activities in order to give 
		my mind adequate rest. Giving my self time to exercise and be outdoors often will do this.
		<br>
		<br>
		In terms of seeking help I will make effective use of the slack channels and other internet forums in order to get over any difficulties I encounter. I expect the facilitation team to be there on occasion when 
		I cannot solve problems through other channels and to have someone to talk ideas through before I apply them to my work.
