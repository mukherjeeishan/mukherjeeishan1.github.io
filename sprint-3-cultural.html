	<h4>What is emotional intelligence?</h4>
	
    <p>The definition of emotional intelligence is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships
	judiciously and empathetically. This is only one definition and there are many variations however they all  touch on the same major points. 
    The three major steps to emotional intelligence are:</p>
	
    1.Attention Training - Paying attention to the processes in our own bodies allows us to have a better grasp on our emotions. Understanding our bodies is
	the key way to access our emotions for the majority of individuals. We can train our minds to pay more and more close attention to our body and emotions.
	This training is what cultivates a better emotive state which leads to a clear calm and alert mind.
	<br>
	<br>
	2.Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery – With an attentive mind we are able to analyse our internal processes much more effectively. Through this we grow 
	a greater understanding of who we are, and how we engage when faced with particular situations. With this increased self-knowledge comes mastery, 
	we now know what are reactions are in certain situations and can draw from past experience and reflection in order to regulate this.
	<br>
	<br>
	3.Creating Useful Mental Habits – Developing good mental habits is the key to defending our selves against our super egos (the critical, judging mind).
	Simple habits can change the way we approach situations and ultimately lead to critical thoughts being changed to positive thoughts that further our 
	progress.

	<h4>EQ vs IQ</h4>
	
	<p>IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges. EQ is a better indicator of 
	success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves. While both are measures of intelligence
	they look at different aspects, it is important to know that having a high eq isn’t useful without some iq and vice versa.</p>

	<h4>Mindfulness</h4>
	
	<p>This part of the challenge was interesting as it was something I had never done before. I found meditating through the mindfulness app to be extremely
	relaxing and refreshing. As I was meditating I noticed all my thoughts began to slip away until the point where I was completely lost in just pure 
	feeling and sensation. I found the first experience extremely useful, I felt like it gave my mind the refresh it needed to just reset and start 
	thinking from scratch again. Afterwards it was much easier to focus and process thoughts and I seem to have far few worries. My daily habit 
	commitment to start with is to do 3 minutes a day every day right after breakfast.  If I had any bias going into this meditation it was a positive one,
	I told myself that this would be very useful and it turned out to be.</p>
