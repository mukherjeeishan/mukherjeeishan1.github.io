		<h2>Sprint 4 Technical</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Problem solving</h3>
		<br>
		
		<p>During the kata section of sprint for there were many instances where i was stuck trying to understand basic code syntax and the scope of where my functions
		were pointing too. In order to move past theese i had to use a range of probklem solving techniques i had learned to find a soluition so i could make further
		progress.
		<br>
		My biggest problem i encountered again and again was just reminding myself of the exact syntax i had to use for my javascript aswell as how to refference
		different variables from different places. At first i tried to solve this by googling for answers and using the error messages toi figure out where my code was incorrect.
		For the most part theese methods solved most of my issues howvere when this wasnt enough i turned to my coaches and peers and asked for help through the slack channel.
		I found that while no one necessarily gave me an outrighjt answer at first they slowly worked through the issue with me to a point where i could understand why i went wrong and thus
		knew what steps i had to take to correct the issue. I learnt that often it is best to ask youre cohort for help as some people are further advanced than others and 
		would have encountered the exact same difficulties i was having previosuly in their own work.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I feel like i am fairly confident with using most of the problem solving trechniques we have been learning however there are two or three that stick out to me
		that i feel i could make better use of. Theese wpould be pseudocode, the rubber ducky method and using reflection more efficitvely. I often foudn myself getting stuck 
		only to come back a few hours later to immediatly see the issue as i had given my self some time to refelct and think about the issue rather than just staring at lines of cod.
		Also my planning using psuedocode could be done better in order to give myself a better understanding of the overall solution before i even start writing code. I feel often at times just taking a step back and allowing
		myself to reflect will give me much faster learning and progress.
