	<h3>Analogy to describe the differences between html and CSS</h3>

<p>Html is the language we use to create our websites. It is the backbone of every webpage and is what allows us to actually add content which could be text, 
pictures, files etc. We can also style the content on a webpage using html however its ability to do so is limited and can make our code fairly complicated. 
CSS is the language that we use to add styling to the content we created using html. It describes how our html elements are to be displayed and it is CSS that makes a good website look nice and easy to read.
To have this as an easy to understand analogy we can think about building a house. The html is like the foundations and the structure of the house. 
It describes what rooms would be in the house and how it is laid out. At this point our house would be complete however it would look bare and lack any 
colour or styling. CSS is like the design of the house, it is what would control the colours of paint, wallpaper, size of our rooms, carpets etc.
 Without adding some style and design to our house it would be complete but look very bare so CSS is what would make the house look nice and individual.</p>

<h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>

<p>A programmes control flow is the order in which it executes statements. A loop in programming is a sequence of instruction that is continually repeated
 until certain conditions are met. A common layout for a loop in programming is an if statement followed by an else statement. A real-life example could
 be simply waking up at a set time e.g if I wake up before 9am stay in bed but if it is past 9am get up and have breakfast. If we were to write this 
 out it would look like this :
 <br>
 <br>
Wake up check time
If time < 9am stay in bed
<br>
Else (time > 9am)
Get up and make breakfast</p>

<h3>What is the DOM and how can we interact with it</h3>

<p>The DOM (document object model) is a representation of the all the structure and content on a webpage. The document is just our webpage itself
(the html document), the objects are elements of the page (head tags div tages etc) and the model which describes how these elements are laid out in 
 a hierarchal fashion.
The best way to interact with the dom is probably through the use of chrome developer tools. This allows us to view, interact ands change any aspects of
 the webpage in the dom. Anything we change will be instantly seen on the webpage however if we reload our page only the original content will be shown. 
 Saying this however we can link our dom to our local files on our machine so that any changes we make are permanent.</p>
 
<h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>

An array is used when order is an important factor in organizing information. When we retrieve information from an array we use the index of each element in the array. Arrays are 0 indexed which means the count starts from 0 rather than 1. Objects are best when we want to organise information based on data labels we do not use an index to access information from an object but instead use a set data label.
A good way to think about this is looking at a book vs a newspaper. In a book it is important that we maintain an order (you would not skip to the third chapter) whereas in a newspaper the order is not important but the labelling of the different sections are (sports news should be in the sports section). If we wanted to access the 1st chapter of an array named books we would use 
Books [0]
Compared with accessing the sports section of an object newspaper we would use 
Newspaper.sports 

<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>


<p>A function is a named section of a programme that performs a specific task. They combine many sets of instructions into a single line of code. 
They are useful because they allow to break down our program into smaller steps if it becomes to complex and saves us the hassle of rewriting 
long sections of code every time we want to use them. It also helps us to keep our variable namespace clean so we can use the same named variables 
again and again in separate functions.</p>
