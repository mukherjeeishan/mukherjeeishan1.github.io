		<p>
		Throughout my foundations progress I have continued to learn more and more about myself and my study habits through the core learning
		sections. These learnings I have made have had a significant impact on the way I approach my learning. I feel that the biggest change
		that has occurred for me is that I tend to plan out my learning much more effectively and manage my time better. Instead of jumping
		into something new by simply starting an exercise I know take the timer to look at the learning objective as a whole and plan out 
		how much time I would like to spend on different sections.
<br>		I have learnt that I work well in short bursts and that it is important
		for me to take regular breaks in order to be most efficient. I have also learned the importance of having a stable and healthy body
		and mind before you sit down to work. This is the key to getting effective use of your time.</p>
		<br>
			<p>If anything surprised me about the core learning it was probably the overall effect, it has had on my work and study habits. Initially when
               approaching the core, I found that I was doubting the content and had the opinion that it was not going to do much for me and that it was 
         just an admin part of the course for me to complete however after completing foundations I can say that this is not true at all. The most 
 challenging aspect was the parts of the core that got you to complete self-reflection. I found this hard because it requires you to 
 know you well (especially for strengths and weaknesses).</p>
