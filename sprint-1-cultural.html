		<p><h3> Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
		1.     Describe your core personal values
		<br>
	
•      Respect – To me respect is about having due regard for other people’s ideas, feelings and exhibiting care for the needs of others.
<br>
•      Understanding – is having the ability to look at things from other’s view point and breaking down why they may act or think the way they do.
<br>
•      Patience – is the ability to give yourself time and not get frustrated and also give others the same time.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
2.     Explain a situation where you had an ethical decision to make
<br>
 
Ethics are moral principle that govern our behavior or the way we conduct an activity. An ethical dilemma I am commonly faced with is when going to restaurants whether to leave my plate om the table or to return them to the kitchen. Even though it is not required to do as it is someone’s job in the restaurant to clear the table I always find myself returning the plates myself as this is the way I have been brought up.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
3.     Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity
<br>
 
•      I have been born and brought up in New Zealand, however lived in a family with foreign background. This has given me a sense of curiosity and respect for all kinds of cultures as I have grown up. In terms of values and identity, my culture has definitely impacted this, however this is one of many factors. I feel that since I am still quite young my values and identity are constantly changing. That I am still figuring out the kind of person I want to be.

<br>
<br>
o   Curiosity
<br>
o   Decent technical background
<br>

<br>
•   Limitations
