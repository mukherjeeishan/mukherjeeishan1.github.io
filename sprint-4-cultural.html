		<h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>
		<br>
		
		 <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
		 <br>
			<p>Until recently the conventional thinking about our brains was that they are hardwired at birth and therefore were unchangeable, in reality our brains are
			 like a malleable plastic that is constantly changing and adapting to experiences.
			 
			Neuroplasticity is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in our brains. Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organisation of
			 connections between neurons in our brains. When people repeatedly practice an activity or access a memory, their neural networks (groups of neurons 
			 that fire together creating electrochemical pathways) shape themselves according to that activity or memory. When people stop practising new things the
			 brain will eventually eliminate or prune the connecting sells that formed the pathways as they are not needed anymore. This is similar to how road networks 
			 are created more traffic equals more important roads so more lanes and as roads become unused they are effectively taken of the map.</p>
			 
			<p>When we explain principals of neuroplasticity to people and help them understand their brain is like a malleable sponge their ability to perform can 
			increase, this has been proven in several research studies completed. The reason for this is that people become more motivated to study when they know 
			and understand that they are fully capable of of building knowledge and physically changing their brains as opposed to the traditional view where some 
			people are better suited to things than others or that intelligence is predetermined</p>
			
			<p>From a personal standpoint understanding these principals can be an extremely useful knowledge when approaching new tasks and learning new skills. 
			Simply understanding that our brains are capable of learning and adapting to almost anything gives a huge motivation boost, knowing that the task 
			is achievable from the get-go rather than looking at as impossible with a current skill set.</p>
			
			<p>To increase the neuroplasticity of your brain there are a few important steps. Practice and repetition of an activity will help to build stronger,
			more hardwired connections in the brain. Putting information into context, recognizing that learning is essentially the formation of new neural
			connections, it makes sense to prioritize activities that help students tap into existing pathways. E.g. Integrating academic subjects or creating 
			projects with real world applications. Whenever new material is presented in a way that students can see relationships between concepts,
			they generate greater brain cell activity and achieve more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval.</p>

			<h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
			<br>
			<p>The growth mindset is the idea that we can grow our brains capacity to learn and solve problems. In a fixed mindset student believe their basic 
			abilities, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and thatâ€™s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the 
			time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching 
			and persistence.</p>
			
			<p>Upon looking into the growth mindset I was surprised at the amount of evidence that backs up this this theory. Often in the past I have come 
			across this theory but not given it much thought but on seeing the evidence I fully back this theory..  Its application in a sport was also
			particularly interesting and was something I thought that I could apply to my own pursuits in the athletic world as well as in the classroom.
			I can apply the growth mindset to my future endeavours by looking at a problems I cannot solve as opportunities to learn rather than an
			opportunity to fail.</p>
